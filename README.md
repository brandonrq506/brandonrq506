- 👋 Hi, I’m @brandonrq506
- 👀 I’m interested in understanding how everything around me works, from a ATM to a plant doing photosynthesis
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, C# and Web Development
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on many open-source projects. Hopefully get a taste of how working on a big project is, submitting PRs, commiting to get work experience.
- 📫 How to reach me: I always have my email tab open, you can reach out to me at darkradhd@gmail.com
